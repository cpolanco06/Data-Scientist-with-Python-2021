### Scholarship: Data Challenge 365 FEM - DataCamp
Training to study data science with Python (2020-2021)
- In this track, I learned how this versatile language enables me to import, clean, manipulate, and visualize data - all comprehensive skills for any aspiring data professional or researcher.
- Through interactive exercises, I was able to familiarize myself with some of the most popular Python libraries, including pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and many more.
- Then I worked with real-world data sets to learn the statistical and machine learning techniques needed to train decision trees and use natural language processing (NLP).
